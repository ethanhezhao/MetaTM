MetaTM (Topic Modelling with Metadata) consists of the software packages of a series of the state-of-the-art topic models for text analysis, which leverage metadata such as document labels and word embeddings to boost the performance and interpretability of topic models. In particular, MetaTM enjoys significantly better performance on analysing short texts, such as tweets or news abstracts. MetaTM can be used to visualise the topical content of a given corpus, as well as to perform tasks like document classification and clustering.

MetaTM consists of three packages:
1. [MetaLDA](https://github.com/ethanhezhao/MetaLDA) incorporates binary metadata, with a scalable multi-thread Java implementation. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06365)
2. [MetaFTM](https://github.com/ethanhezhao/MetaFTM) enables topics to focused on the most related words informed by word embeddings. [paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v77/zhao17a/zhao17a.pdf)
3. [MIGA](https://github.com/ethanhezhao/MIGA) is a topic-based document clustering model informed by document labels. [paper](https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P19/P19-1396/)
